Accessing Your Environment\n\nYour Dynatrace environment is accessed via a URL specific to your tenant:\n\n```\nhttps://{tenant-id}.apps.dynatrace.com\n```\n\n### Finding Your Tenant ID\n\nYour tenant ID is the first part of your Dynatrace URL. For example:\n- URL: `https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com`\n- Tenant ID: `abc12345`\n\n**Write down your tenant ID**—you'll need it for API tokens, OneAgent deployment, and integrations.\n\n### First Login\n\n1. Navigate to your tenant URL\n2. Enter your credentials (local user or SSO)\n3. Complete any MFA requirements\n4. You'll land on the default home screen\n\n> **Note:** If your organization is setting up SAML/SSO, see **ONBRD-02: IAM and Authentication** before inviting additional users."},{"id":"9c79c355-a2c3-4e1b-91e0-73cfd980a9e5","type":"markdown","markdown":"## 2. Understanding the Navigation\n\nDynatrace uses a left-hand navigation menu organized by function. The platform is built around **Apps**—each capability is an app you can launch.\n\n![Navigation Structure](../images/navigation-structure.svg)\n<!-- MARKDOWN_TABLE_ALTERNATIVE\n| Area | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| Search (Cmd+K) | Quick access to anything |\n| Apps Menu | Platform capabilities (Dashboards, Notebooks, Problems, etc.) |\n| Main Content | Workspace for analysis and monitoring |\n| Settings | Configuration options |\n| Account Management | Users, tokens, permissions |\n-->\n\n### Quick Search\n\nPress **Cmd+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) to open the quick search. Type anything:\n- Entity names (hosts, services)\n- App names\n- Keywords like \"logs\" or \"problems\"\n\n### The App Launcher\n\nClick the grid icon to see all available apps. You can:\n- Pin frequently used apps to your sidebar\n- Discover new apps in the Dynatrace Hub\n- Install apps from the Hub to extend functionality"},{"id":"80201a24-79da-46e4-97d2-0ba12b1aba19","type":"markdown","markdown":"## 3. Key Areas to Know\n\n### Hosts App\n\nThe Hosts app shows all monitored infrastructure:\n- Host health and resource utilization\n- Running processes and services\n- Host properties and metadata\n\n### Problems App\n\nDAVIS AI automatically detects problems and correlates related events. This is where you'll see:\n- Active issues requiring attention\n- Root cause analysis\n- Affected entities\n- Problem timeline and resolution\n\n### Logs & Events App\n\nExplore all log data ingested into Dynatrace:\n- Full-text search across logs\n- Filter by source, severity, content\n- Correlate logs with traces and metrics\n\n### Notebooks App\n\nInteractive analysis environment (you're using one now!):\n- Write and execute DQL queries\n- Document investigations\n- Share findings with your team\n\n### Workflows App\n\nAutomation and alerting for the modern platform:\n- Create automated responses to problems\n- Configure notifications (Slack, email, PagerDuty, etc.)\n- Build custom automation logic"},{"id":"6b9b1f3c-2e7e-46c2-9bf6-c5a2b94f4e56","type":"markdown","markdown":"## 4. Your Environment ID and URLs\n\nSeveral URLs are important to bookmark:\n\n| Purpose | URL Pattern |\n|---------|-------------|\n| **Main UI** | `https://{tenant-id}.apps.dynatrace.com` |\n| **Platform API** | `https://{tenant-id}.apps.dynatrace.com/platform/` |\n| **OAuth Clients** | Account Management → OAuth clients |\n\n### API Access\n\nThe modern Dynatrace platform uses OAuth 2.0 for API authentication:\n\n1. Create an OAuth client in Account Management\n2. Use the client credentials flow to obtain tokens\n3. Include the bearer token in API requests\n\nFor OneAgent deployment, you'll still use API tokens (covered in ONBRD-04)."},{"id":"a6ad515e-71c1-43d9-999f-d4932c8c73dc","type":"markdown","markdown":"## 5.

Next Steps\n\nNow that you're oriented in the Dynatrace UI, proceed based on your priorities:\n\n### Recommended Path\n\n1. **ONBRD-02: IAM and Authentication** - Set up SAML/SSO and user permissions before inviting your team\n2. **ONBRD-03: Deploying ActiveGate** - Set up network routing (if needed)\n3. **ONBRD-04: Deploying OneAgent** - Start getting infrastructure data\n4. **ONBRD-05: Organizing Your Environment** - Set up tags, segments, and naming conventions\n\n### Migrating from Another Platform?\n\nIf you're migrating from New Relic, Datadog, or another APM tool, check out the **USFOODS** series which provides:\n\n- Concept mapping from your previous platform to Dynatrace\n- Query translation guides (e.g., NRQL → DQL)\n- Integration patterns for your existing tools\n- A recommended learning path that interleaves ONBRD fundamentals with migration-specific content\n\n> **See USFOODS-01** for a complete learning path that combines ONBRD foundation with migration-focused deep dives.\n\n### Key Tasks Before Moving On\n\n- [ ] Bookmark your tenant URL\n- [ ] Note your tenant ID\n- [ ] Explore the App Launcher\n- [ ] Open the Hosts app (even if empty)\n- [ ] Find Account Management for tokens and users\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this notebook, you learned:\n\n- How to access your Dynatrace environment\n- The app-based navigation structure\n- Key apps: Hosts, Problems, Logs & Events, Notebooks, Workflows\n- Important URLs for your tenant\n- How to check what data already exists\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- [Get Started with Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/get-started)\n- [Navigate the Dynatrace Platform](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/get-started/dynatrace-ui)\n- [Dynatrace Community - Start with Dynatrace](https://community.dynatrace.com/t5/Start-with-Dynatrace/bd-p/GetStarted)"}],"name":"--ONBRD-01-first-steps"}
