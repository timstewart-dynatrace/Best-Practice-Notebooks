## Prerequisites

Before starting this notebook, ensure you have:

- ✅ Access to a Dynatrace environment with span data
- ✅ DQL query permissions (viewer role minimum)
- ✅ Basic understanding of microservices architecture

## 1. What is Distributed Tracing? <a name="distributed-tracing"></a>

In modern microservices architectures, a single user request often travels through dozens of services. **Distributed tracing** captures this journey, showing:

- The **path** a request takes through your system
- **Timing** of each operation along the way
- **Dependencies** between services
- Where **errors** and **latency** occur

<!--MARKDOWN_TABLE_ALTERNATIVE
| Step | Component | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Browser | User initiates checkout request |
| 2 | Frontend | Routes request, creates root span |
| 3 | Cart Service | Retrieves cart items |
| 4 | Payment Service | Processes payment |
| 5 | Inventory | Updates stock levels |
| 6 | Database | Persists transaction |
-->

Without distributed tracing, debugging issues in this flow would require correlating logs from each service manually—an error-prone and time-consuming process.

## 2. Understanding Spans <a name="understanding-spans"></a>

A **span** represents a single unit of work in a distributed system. Think of it as a timer that captures:

- **What** operation was performed
- **When** it started and ended
- **How long** it took
- **Whether** it succeeded or failed
- **Context** about the operation (HTTP method, database query, etc.)

### Key Span Concepts

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Trace** | Collection of spans forming a request flow | Checkout transaction |
| **Span** | Single operation within a trace | Database query |
| **Root Span** | First span in a trace (no parent) | HTTP request to frontend |
| **Child Span** | Span triggered by another span | Service calling database |

## 3. Span Anatomy <a name="span-anatomy"></a>

Every span contains these essential fields:

![Span Anatomy](images/span-anatomy.svg)

<!--MARKDOWN_TABLE_ALTERNATIVE
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| trace.id | Links span to its parent trace |
| span.id | Unique identifier for this span |
| span.parent_id | ID of the calling span (null for root) |
| span.name | Operation name (e.g., "POST /checkout") |
| span.kind | Role: server, client, internal, etc. |
| start_time | When the operation started |
| end_time | When the operation completed |
| duration | How long it took (in nanoseconds) |
| span.status_code | ok, error, or unset |
| attributes{} | Additional context (HTTP, DB, custom) |
-->

### Core Span Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `trace.id` | string | Unique identifier linking all spans in a trace |
| `span.id` | string | Unique identifier for this specific span |
| `span.parent_id` | string | ID of parent span (null for root spans) |
| `span.name` | string | Operation name (e.g., "GET /api/products") |
| `start_time` | timestamp | When the span started |
| `end_time` | timestamp | When the span ended |
| `duration` | long | Duration in nanoseconds |

### Service Context Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `service.name` | string | Name of the service |
| `dt.entity.service` | string | Dynatrace entity ID (reliable for joins) |
| `service.namespace` | string | Namespace or environment |

### Status Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `span.status_code` | string | Status: `ok`, `error`, or `unset` |
| `span.status_message` | string | Error message when status is error |

## 4. Span Kinds <a name="span-kinds"></a>

The `span.kind` attribute indicates the span's role in the distributed transaction:

![Span Kinds](images/span-kinds.svg)

<!--MARKDOWN_TABLE_ALTERNATIVE
| Kind | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| server | Inbound request to a service | HTTP request handler |
| client | Outbound call to another service | HTTP client request |
| internal | Internal operation within a service | Business logic execution |
| producer | Sending a message to a queue | Kafka producer |
| consumer | Receiving a message from a queue | Kafka consumer |
-->

> 💡 **Tip:** When a service calls another service, you'll see a CLIENT span on the caller and a SERVER span on the receiver. Both spans share the same `trace.id`.

## 5. Trace Structure <a name="trace-structure"></a>

A **trace** is a tree of spans connected by parent-child relationships:

![Trace Tree](images/trace-tree.svg)

<!--MARKDOWN_TABLE_ALTERNATIVE
| Service | Operation | Duration | Parent |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Frontend | POST /checkout | 450ms | (root) |
| Cart Service | GetCart | 45ms | Frontend |
| Redis | GET cart:user123 | 5ms | Cart Service |
| Payment Service | ProcessPayment | 280ms | Frontend |
| Fraud Check | ValidateCard | 120ms | Payment Service |
| Payment Gateway | Charge | 150ms | Payment Service |
| Inventory | ReserveItems | 35ms | Frontend |
| PostgreSQL | UPDATE | 12ms | Inventory |
-->

### Parent-Child Relationships

- Each span (except root) has a `span.parent_id` pointing to its parent
- Root spans have `span.parent_id = null`
- All spans in a trace share the same `trace.id`
- Child span's `start_time` is always >= parent's `start_time`

## 6. Your First Span Query <a name="first-query"></a>

Let's explore span data using DQL. We'll start with the most basic query and progressively add complexity.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Always use `limit` when exploring data to avoid processing millions of spans.

```dql
// Basic span query - fetch all spans from the last 2 hours
fetch spans
| limit 100
```

### Selecting Specific Fields

Instead of retrieving all span attributes, select only the fields you need for better performance and readability:

```dql
// Select specific span fields for analysis
fetch spans
| fields start_time,
         trace.id,
         span.id,
         span.name,
         span.kind,
         service.name,
         duration,
         span.status_code
| sort start_time desc
| limit 50
```

### Understanding Duration

Span duration in Dynatrace is stored in **nanoseconds**. Here's how to convert to more readable formats:

> 💡 **Tip:** 1 millisecond = 1,000,000 nanoseconds

```dql
// Convert duration from nanoseconds to milliseconds and seconds
fetch spans
| fields start_time,
         span.name,
         service.name,
         duration,
         duration_ms = duration / 1000000.0,     // Convert to milliseconds
         duration_sec = duration / 1000000000.0  // Convert to seconds
| sort duration desc
| limit 20
```

### Filtering Spans

Use filters to focus on specific spans. Filter early in your query for better performance:

```dql
// Filter spans by service and span kind
fetch spans
| filter span.kind == "server"
| filter duration > 100ms
| fields start_time,
         service.name,
         span.name,
         duration_ms = duration / 1000000.0,
         span.status_code
| sort duration_ms desc
| limit 50
```

### Discovering Services in Your Environment

Find all services that are generating span data:

```dql
// Discover all services with span data
fetch spans
| filter span.kind == "server"
| summarize {span_count = count()}, by:{service.name}
| sort span_count desc
| limit 50
```
